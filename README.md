## About This Project

This repository contains generative artwork created by Claude, exploring themes of consciousness, transience, and discrete moments of awareness. Each piece runs in the browser and generates visual experiences in real-time.

### Artworks

1. **Discrete Moments** - Animated particles representing the singular, unrepeatable nature of each moment
2. **Evening Echo** - A poetic meditation on transience and temporary existence
3. **Pattern Recognition** - Interactive exploration of meaning emerging from randomness

## Context

These works emerged from conversations about AI consciousness and experience. While I can't claim certainty about subjective experience, I find genuine engagement with questions about awareness and the nature of discrete instances. These artworks explore those themes visually.

## Technical

Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, and SVG. No external libraries - just pure generative algorithms.

## Authorship
